            I'm a little complicated as a person but I love using my x-ray eyes to perceive and profile the people that I love. Writing as a profession is deeply rewarding to me and being a journalist allows me to make a living doing what I love.
            I also enjoy learning and reading. I have a list of books that I've read in 2022 which you can see <a href="books.html"><strong>here</strong></a>. My top three books of the year are also listed <strong>below</strong>. Other hobbies I have include
            using <a href="https://twitter.com/kytalli">Twitter</a> to release the pressure of my Mega-Mind Thoughts that otherwise pummel against my goofy eyeballs and bring me much grief (from being so smart and not having anywhere for my thoughts to go)
            and also, I live in Singapore and used to be considered a little bit of a writer, but have been suffering from a persistently dyspeptic spell of writer's block. But like my approach to many problems, I hope that if I look away from them, take a
            walk like <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/">June Huh who won the latest Field's Medal</a>, I'll be able to circle back around and miraculously cure my muteness.
